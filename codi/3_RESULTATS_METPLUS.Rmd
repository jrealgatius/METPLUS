## Study Objectives and Endpoints:

# The primary objective:

To compare the proportion of patients achieving the reduction in HbA1c values of at least 0.5%, a weight reduction of at least 3%, after the addition of a SU, an DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i to the treatment with metformin in patients with T2DM and insufficient glycemic control in the medium-long term, up to a maximum of 24 months of follow-up. 

***

# Secondary objectives: 

- To estimate the mean reduction of HbA1c and body weight separately after the addition of an SU, a DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i in patients with DM2 treated with metformin and insufficient glycemic control (up to 24 months).
- To assess the average reduction in systolic blood pressure after the addition of an SU, a DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i in patients with DM2 treated with metformin and insufficient glycemic control.
- To assess the evolution of lipid profile (mean total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides) after the addition of an SU, a DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i in patients with DM2 treated with metformin and insufficient control glycemic. 
- To assess  the adherence to treatment after the addition of an SU, a DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i in patients with DM2 treated with metformin and insufficient glycemic control.
- To assess  the percentage of suspensions/dropouts of treatment at 6, 12 and 24 months (persistence of treatment).
- To describe the relevant adverse reactions produced after the addition of an SU, an DPP-4i or an SGLT-2i in patients with DM2 treated with metformin and insufficient glycemic control.
- To describe the comorbidity profile and baseline clinical characteristics of patients with DM2 and insufficient control with metformin in monotherapy after addition of a treatment with SU, DPP-4i or SGLT-2i.
- the reductions will be evaluated up to 12 months and a maximum of 24 months after the addition of the treatment or end of follow-up.
